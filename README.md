# VotingSystem

This React Native application simulates a real voting scenario. After the user enters their ID number and phone number, they are directed to the selection screen. An Ethereum wallet is automatically generated based on the ID number and securely stored in local storage using EncryptedStorage for enhanced security. The user then chooses an image, and upon confirmation of the voting process, a success message is displayed.
